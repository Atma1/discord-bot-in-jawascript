Before starting I need to tell you something the process of setting up the bot might seems very complicated and require a great amount of techincal knowledge but fear not as long as you have the motivation to keep pushing and go forward it will not intimidate you.
# About

A discord bot made in JavaScript that will enable the capabilty of remote ban using Discord.js, Firebase Firestore for the database and Node.js for the backend.

# How to setup the bot:

1. Create a discord bot by going to discord developer portal and create a Firebase Firestore account.
2. Get an IDE or code editor-e.g. Visual Code Studio or Repl.
3. Clone the repository.
4. Get the .env file found near the bottom of this text extract it from the .zip file and insert it your bot's folder.
5. In the .env file add your bot token and you may costumize the bot's prefix if you would like to.
6. Download your firebase admin SDK JSON by going to firebase project settings and look for a tab called service accounts then click create service account.
7. Insert the SDK to the bot's folder and rename it to serviceAccount and keep the .json.
8. Install the dependencies. If you are using a code editor type in the shell/command prompt npm i or if you are using Repl it'll auto install all the dependencies after you've run the bot.
9. Deploy the bot to your server using the bot's invite link located in your discord developer portal and make sure every thing is norminal.
