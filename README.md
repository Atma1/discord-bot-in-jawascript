# Remote Ban Discord Bot in JawaScript

Before starting I need to tell you something, the process of setting up the bot might seems very complicated and requrie a great amount of techincal knowledge, but fear not, as long as you have the motivation to keep pushing and go forward it will not intimidate you and I am sure you CAN finish it and go home without being empty handed.

# About

A discord bot made in JawaScript that will enable the capabilty of remote ban using Firebase Firestore for the database and Node.js for the backend.

# How to use:

1. Create a discord bot by going to discord developer portal and create a Firebase Firestore account.
2. Get an IDE or code editor-e.g., Visual Code Studio or Repl.
3. Clone the repository. 
4. In the config.json file insert your bot token and cloud firestore database link.
5. Download your firebase admin SDK by going to firebase project settings and look for a tab called service accounts then click create service account.
6. Insert it to the bot's folder and rename it to serviceAccount and keep the .json.
7. Install the dependencies. If you are using a code editor type in the shell/command prompt npm i or if you are using Repl it'll auto install all the dependencies after you've run the bot.
8. Deploy to your server using the bot invite link located in your discord developer portal.
9. Make sure the bot works.
